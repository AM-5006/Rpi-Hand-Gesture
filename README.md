# Raspberry Pi Hand Geture Control

## Overview

The Hand Gesture Control Project is a Raspberry Pi-based project that allows users to control both hardware and software applications using hand gestures. The project uses computer vision and gesture recognition to detect hand movements and perform specific actions based on the detected gestures.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Raspberry Pi with a camera module.
   - Python installed on your Raspberry Pi.

2.  **Installation:**
    To run the Facebook Page Poster application, follow these steps:
    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```
      git clone https://github.com/AM-5006/Rpi-Hand-Gesture.git
      cd Rpi-Hand-Gesture
    ```
    Install the required dependencies by running the following command: ```bash pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

3. **Usage:**
   Run the main program using the following command: ```python main.py```
     - After running main.py, a graphical user interface (GUI) will appear on your screen.
     - The GUI provides two options: "Control Hardware" and "Control Software."
     - Select one of the options by clicking the corresponding button.
     - To exit the application, simply close the GUI window. The application will stop, and any hardware or software control actions will cease.
